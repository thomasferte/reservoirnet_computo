# Reservoir Computing in R: a Tutorial for Using reservoirnet to Predict Complex Time-Series

Reservoir Computing (RC) is a machine learning method based on neural networks that
efficiently process information generated by dynamical systems. It has been successful
in solving various tasks including time series forecasting, language processing or
voice processing. RC is implemented in `Python` and `Julia` but not in `R`. This article
introduces `reservoirnet`, an `R` package providing access to the `Python` API `ReservoirPy`,
allowing `R` users to harness the power of reservoir computing. This article provides an
introduction to the fundamentals of RC and showcases its real-world applicability through
three distinct sections. First, we cover the foundational concepts of RC, setting the
stage for understanding its capabilities. Next, we delve into the practical usage of
`reservoirnet` through two illustrative examples. These examples demonstrate how it
can be applied to real-world problems, specifically, regression of COVID-19 hospitalizations
and classification of Japanese vowels. Finally, we present a comprehensive analysis
of a real-world application of `reservoirnet`, where it was used to forecast COVID-19
hospitalizations at Bordeaux University Hospital using public data and electronic health records.
